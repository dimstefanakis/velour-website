## Structure

### 1. Hero Section
- **Background:** Soft, warm tones (rose, blush, muted gold). Subtle vignette or gradient to create intimacy.
- **Headline (large, serif, feminine):**
  *"Your Next Secret Obsession"*
- **Subheadline (smaller, sans-serif):**
  *Bite-sized romance stories you can listen to anywhere, anytime.*
- **Primary CTA:**
  - Single input field (email) + button: **“Join the Waitlist”**
  - Button styling: Rounded, slightly elevated, with a romantic accent color (deep red or plum).

---

### 2. Emotional Hook
- **Text block with large pull-quote style text:**
  *“90 seconds is all it takes to fall into a new romance…”*
- Tone: Intimate, whispery. Should feel like an invitation, not a pitch.

---

### 3. How It Works (very brief)
- **Three simple icons + captions:**
  1. 🎧 *Listen to short romance stories*
  2. 💌 *Get hooked by irresistible cliffhangers*
  3. 🔮 *Shape where the drama goes next*
- Keep copy minimal and emotional—avoid technical or AI references.

---

### 4. Testimonials (Placeholder)
- Add 2–3 fictional preview testimonials (italics, soft grey font):
  - *“It feels like someone’s telling me a secret.”*
  - *“Finally, drama made just for me.”*

---

### 5. Final CTA
- **Centered large text:**
  *“Be the first to know when the story begins.”*
- Repeat email input + button.
- Add trust signal: *“No spam. Just stories.”*

---

### 6. Footer
- Minimal:
  - Logo (wordmark style, elegant serif).
  - Links: Privacy Policy, Terms (tiny font).
  - Socials optional (only if brand-ready).

---

## Design Language
- **Typography:**
  - Headings: Elegant serif (Playfair Display, Libre Baskerville).
  - Body: Clean sans-serif (Lato, Open Sans).
- **Colors:** Warm, romantic, and mature (rose, blush, ivory, muted gold, deep plum).
- **Imagery:** Subtle textures (paper, fabric) instead of stock photos. Keep it abstract and sensual, not literal.
- **Tone:** Intimate, mysterious, emotional. Should feel like a secret club for romance lovers.
